CDMetaPOP input files
---

cdmats-- Cost-distance matrices represent connectivity scenarios. Separate spring/summer matrices reflect partial barriers or seasonal dewatering. These files were the same for all parameter spaces.

classvars-- Class files for migratory YCT, resident YCT, and RBT. These files were the same for all parameter spaces.

genes-- allelic frequencies for YCT and RBT. These were used in hybridization simulations.

Life History Only -- patchvars and popvars inputs for "all resident" and "life history variation". Separate inputs for simulations run with/without impacts of brown and brook trout.

Hybridization -- patchvars and popvars inputs for "hybridization" including 3 assortative mating options ("AM"). Separate inputs for simulations run with/without impacts of brown and brook trout.

Hybridization + Life History -- patchvars and popvars inputs for "hybridization + life history variation" including 3 assortative mating options ("AM"). Separate inputs for simulations run with/without impacts of brown and brook trout.
